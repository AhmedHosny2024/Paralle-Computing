Moreover, we aim to compare the outcomes of our low-level implementations with the built-in functions in popular frameworks as Pytorch.

        "\n",
        "As we already know, array memory representation in cuda is linear, making higher-dimensional arrays represented also in a 1D fashion. That's why we need to flatten a 2D matrix to pass it to cuda in a row-major representation, making indexing kind of tedious. Now the question that pops-up: Could we in any way pass a 2D-organised array to cuda to do a more convenient double indexing?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answer is: Yes! Yet, this comes with some limitations. To pass a 2D array and carry out double indexing in cuda, this array has to be statically allocated by the CPU, not dynamically allocated, so you need to know the array dimensions at the compile time. This way, the compiler is aware about the width of the 2D array, and can do the linearization process on its own. Moreover, a statically allocated array will be represented in memory in a contiguous 1D fashion. In contrast, if you dynamically allocate your matrix, you may or may not gurantee that all elements of the 2D array are contiguous, depending on the allocation fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "A call to malloc here does not necessarily gurantee that the allocated memory is just after its preceding ones. Such discontinuouty makes it hard for the compiler to carry out the linearization."
